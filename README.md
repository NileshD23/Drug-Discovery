# Drug-Discovery
Bioinformatics project taught by Data Professor on YouTube:
 - Part 1: Data Collection and Data-Processing
      - Download and pre-process biological activity data from the ChEMBL database to perform computational drug discovery
 - Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
      - Take dataset from Part 1 and use the SMILES notation to compute Lipinski descriptors (molecular weight, LogP, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors)
 - Part 3: Dataset Preparation
      - Compute molecular descriptors using the PADEL-Descriptor
 - Part 4: Model Building
      - Use computed molecular descriptors from Part 3 to build a regression model for predicting the pIC50 values
